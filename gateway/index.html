  <h1>Gateway to University Honors</h1>
  <h3>Mini Experience Showcase</h3>
  <p>
  For Gateway to University Honors, I had the opportunity to participate in a mini-experience. My group chose to travel
    to Clark Montessori to talk to the students about honors programs, UC, and college in general.  
I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to help other students with the college application and selection process, 
    as this was something that I really struggled with.  Going into this mini-experience, I was honestly expecting to 
    give a boring presentation to a large group of disinterested teenagers. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the 
    presentation was more of a discussion, as we sat in a circle of about 15 kids, all of whom were engaged and eager to 
    hear our advice about college. I believe this experience played to my strengths of responsibility and individualization. 
    I could make a connection with individual students and give them advice on a very difficult time in their life. While 
    this experience gave me a chance to give back and help others, it also allowed me to reflect on my own life. I didnâ€™t 
    realize how much I loved UC and the honors program until I found myself telling these students about all the incredible 
    opportunities and positive impacts UC and Honors have had on my life. This mini-experience taught me that I can use my past 
    struggles and life experiences to relate to others and give back to those who are going through the same things.  With
    this knowledge, I will give back to the community and talk to other people with the same struggles. Whether it be college 
    applications, time management, or general relational advice, I have had countless life experiences that I can use to reach out 
    to others. 
    Specifically, I plan to return to my high school and talk to any interested students about UC, the honors program, and engineering.

  <h3>Final Reflection</h3>
  <p>
  The University Honors Program is an incredible program with the ultimate goal to develop students into global citizen scholars.
    To me, a global citizen scholar is a person who uses their cultural knowledge and academic skills to improve the world around 
    them. One of the biggest reasons why I decided to study engineering was to become a global citizen scholar. Engineers solve the
    world's biggest problems. From providing access to clean water, to innovating new energy sources to making safer roads, almost 
    any problem the world faces is being tackled by engineers. Engineering not only utilizes my top strength, analytical, but also 
    helps me pursue my passion to serve others. The University Honors Program gives me the opportunity to do all these things, both 
    through and beyond engineering. I have always loved to travel, and I have visited some really neat places in the United States 
    like Yosemite, shown in the picture to the right, but I've never been abroad. I would like to participate in service trips 
    internationally, whether it be through Serve Beyond Cincinnati, a mission trip, or an Engineers without Borders trip. Regardless 
    of how I go about it, I know UHP will give me the tools to develop my strengths as an engineer, 
    interest in traveling abroad, and values of service and altruism to truly become a global citizen scholar.
