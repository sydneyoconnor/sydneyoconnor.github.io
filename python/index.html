  <h1>Python and Women in Stem</h1>
  <p> Freshman year, I decided to study computer engineering. 
    However, I was shocked at the huge gender gap in the field. 
    In my computer engineering class, I was one of only three girls in a class of over 75 people. 
    This gender gap was not only intimidating, but confusing. Why are so few women in this major?
    Is it just not interesting enough? The summer after freshman year, I was determined to not only 
    become a better computer engineer, but to discover the reasons for this gender gap and find out what can be done to change it.
    This inspired a self-designed Honors experience to study Python as well as the role of women in STEM.

   I began to teach myself Python through various online resources, including Codecademy and PyCharm Edu. This experience
    was a fantastic way to better my skills as a coder and remember why I picked my major in the first place. However, the 
    part of the experience that began to take over and catch my interest even more was researching women in STEM. I watched 
    documentaries, read academic journals and studies, listened to first hand accounts and many more resources, trying to understand
    why there is such a lack of women in STEM, particularly in computer science and engineering. Unfortunately,  there is no clean-cut
    answer or solution to why this problem exists. Many point to a lack of female role models in the field, the stereotype of
    "nerdy men" as computer engineers, and the extreme gender gap and reports of sexual harassment as reasons for why girls tend 
    to choose other fields. I realized that many of these factors almost kept me away. It's so frustrating that there
    are so many women and minorities out there who could be incredible programmers, but think they could never do it.

    This experience taught me so much, not only about why the gap exists, but why its so important to change it and what I can do to
    help with that. Diversity is proven to increase company efficiency and morale. Without a woman's voice and mind in the room or
    working on a project, so many key innovations could be missed. For example, the first voice recognition systems didn't recognize
    a woman's voice. The first airbags killed women and children because the male engineers were only made them to the specs of a
    typical white man. Who knows how many other innovations we could be missing out on even today. While there is still a lot of 
    work to be done to improve women's presence in STEM, we can all help make a change. Even just being a woman in computer engineering
    is huge. I recently joined ROAR tour guides and CEAS Ambassadors, where  I can show potential students that women CAN be computer 
    engineers, and can be successful too. I also have gotten involved with SAC, the Student Alumni Council, where I hope to work
    on connecting female UC grads in the STEM field with current female undergraduate students, 
    to provide mentorship and fight the problem of having no female role models. These little steps can start to make a huge difference.

    Overall, I am incredibly grateful for everything this experience has taught me. Learning Python is an incredibly valuable,
    tangible new skill that will benefit me for years to come. More importantly, this experience instilled a passion in me to help 
    fight the gender gap in my field. While the statistics and stories were frustrating and heart breaking at times, 
    they just convinced me all the more that something needs to be done. I believe my generation can be the one to change it.
