  <h1>Year 1</h1>
  <p>
  Freshman year was a whirlwind. Everyone warned me that it would fly by, but it still amazes me how much happened
    and how  much I grew in what felt like the blink of an eye.  Coming into freshman year, I had no idea what to expect.
    Even though I had been on UC's campus more times than I could count, I still felt like I was entering a completely
    new world. And I was. The first few weeks of college were impossible to process- I was in shock. I graduated in a class
    of 42, and was entering a freshman class of about 6000. At first, the adjustment was really hard. The culture was so 
    different than what I was used to, and I had a really hard time finding my place. As someone who was involved in just
    about everything in high school, I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to do in college. I started out the year in
    the Freshman Engineering Program, where I was in the College of Engineering and Applied Science, but had not yet picked
    a specific discipline and major. The competitive nature of the program and the one semester given to decide my major
    created a lot of stress. My classes were very difficult, and I often questioned if I wanted to be in the College of 
    Engineering at all. Outside of class, I struggled to find student organizations that I really took an interest in. 
    On top of all of this, being away from home and my friends and family for the first time ever was really taking a toll on me.
    I just wanted to go home and get away from all the stress. I nearly lost all hope of having a great freshman year.

    I knew I needed to make a change. I couldn't control the stress of my classes or being away from home, but I could
    change my attitude about it and find other great aspects of college. Despite my initial reluctance, I decided to go 
    through sorority recruitment, which ended up being one of my best decisions of freshman year.  I joined Kappa Alpha Theta,
    where I was able to meet 170 other smart, leading women. Through Theta, I found the support and connections to get involved 
    in other student organizations and get advice on engineering, the classes, and the potential disciplines. By the end of the 
    first semester, I not only kept my GPA intact, but found a discipline of engineering that I loved, and encouraged me that I 
    really was in the right college. Computer Engineering fit me perfectly. I was initially scared of it. I had no programming 
    experience. I'm a woman. I thought I stood no chance in an almost 85% male major who all seemed to have been working with 
    computers since birth. When I took a programming class first semester and fell in love with it, I knew I couldn't let those 
    fears hold me back. I applied to computer engineering over winter break and decided next semester would be different.

    I came back from winter break determined. Determined to find my place, determined to really enjoy my time in college, 
    and determined to fall in love with UC and my major. Over the break, I was accepted to computer engineering, which was
    a huge first step. I also contacted some girls in my sorority about getting involved on campus, and decided to try Student
    Government and CEAS Ambassadors. These decisions transformed my freshman year. My classes were still difficult, but I started
    to really take an interest in what I was learning. There were certainly challenges to having far less programming experience
    than my peers, but I was pleasantly surprised by how kind and helpful my peers, and especially my professors and TA's were.
    At first, I was very intimidated by being one of three girls in my computer engineering class of 75 people. However, because 
    of that, I formed a very close relationship with one of the girls that helped both of us succeed in the class. Outside of class,
    I fell in love with the organizations I joined. I got a position as service chair for my sorority which gave me an awesome 
    opportunity to get more involved as well as give back to the community. I joined Academic Affairs Committee on Student Government, 
    which reminded me how much I love it and why I was president of Student Government in high school. Lastly, CEAS Ambassadors gave 
    me a chance to step back and realize how many amazing opportunities I get here at UC in Engineering. 
    It was a privilege to tell prospective families about the growth I experienced through CEAS and what it could do for them.

  By the end of freshman year, my feelings about college and engineering took nearly a complete 180. I went from overwhelmed 
    and confused to determined and inspired. My fear of being a woman in computer engineering and love for programming inspired 
    me to do a self-designed Honors experience to independently study Python and research women in STEM, which I talk about more 
    here. Despite my struggles, freshman year was a great season of growth and learning for me. I'm excited to take what I've 
    learned this year and use it to get more involved on campus and become a better computer engineer and individual.
