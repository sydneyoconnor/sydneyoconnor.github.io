  <h1>Year 2</h1>
  <p> My second year at UC was filled with big challenges, new opportunities, 
  exciting successes, and most of all, tremendous growth. In the fall semester, 
  I had the opportunity to co-op at L3 Technologies. This was my first introduction
  into the world of professional engineering, and at first, it was terrifying. 
  I had little to no technical skills, was the only girl most of the time, 
  and had to adjust to the culture. It took a while for me to really find my place.
  I once again struggled over whether or not I wanted to be an engineer,
  or if I even had the ability to. However, these challenges pushed me to grow tremendously,
  not just in my skills as an engineer, but personally and professionally. By the end of my co-op,
  I was involved in some really cool projects, and was even able to run some of them independently.
  I got to solve real-world problems and use my communication skills gained from my extracurricular
  activities to present those solutions and effectively work on a team. It was so cool to take what 
  I learned in class and apply it to the real world. Overall, my co-op challenged me and gave me an
  incredible new perspective on engineering that had a huge impact on my second year at UC.

  Unfortunately, being exposed to the professional engineering world meant I was exposed to
  much more than problem solving and teamwork: I was also exposed to the rampant sexism I 
  had always hoped was dying out. Many of my co-workers didn’t take me seriously. I had to 
  work twice as hard as the male co-ops to build a relationship with my supervisor. People 
  constantly asked me if I was sure that engineering is really what I want to do. The other
  male co-ops made blatantly sexist comments to me and had countless inappropriate conversations. 
  For my honors experience last year, I researched the experiences of women in STEM. I heard their
  countless stories of sexism in the workplace, but nothing could have prepared me for how it felt 
  when I was the one being harassed. I felt like an outsider, not welcome in my own workplace.
  When I returned from co-op in the spring, I had a routine meeting with my co-op advisor to review the
  semester. When she asked me about the culture, I mentioned some of these frustrations. A week later, 
  she asked to interview me about these experiences for her research on women in computer engineering.
  I told her the stories of what happened, and began to realize the severity of it all. After hours of 
  pouring out my heart and experiences to her, not only did my advisor affirm me and validate them, 
  but we took it one step further. We decided to do something about it.

  Over the next few months, I made it my mission to change this culture. I joined my co-op advisor’s research 
  team on women in STEM, called POWER, and helped lead a group-level assessment of about 30 women in engineering
  to learn about their experiences. We reached out to various deans of the university and told them about our plan
  to attack the culture of sexism in engineering, and to our surprise, many of them rallied behind us and even 
  offered us funding. We also began working on a mentorship program to give female students in computing at UC an
  older female mentor in the engineering field, which will be launching this coming fall.

  When I walked into that meeting with my advisor, I had no idea that I would discover my passion and ultimately alter
  the trajectory of my college career. This passion was even able to translate over to my many other organizations. 
  I joined ROAR tour guides to serve as a face of women in computing, and encourage incoming students to pursue the field 
  and support other women. I also continued my work as a CEAS Ambassador, and used my involvement in the Student Alumni Council
  to connect alumni to students for the mentorship program. I also served as the Director of Technology for Student Government.
  It was an absolute privilege to be able to use my time, talents and passions to serve the student body this year. It made
  me fall even more in love with the university and with engineering. At the end of the year, I was honored for my work and 
  named the Sophomore Leader of the Year and also won the Leadership Red Rose Award for CWEST. It was incredibly humbling and
  encouraging to have my work recognized, and I am unbelievably excited to see where these next 3 years at UC take me. After
  years of struggling to find my place at the university and fit in to engineering, I finally feel like I have found my 
  purpose and I can’t wait to use it to change the world.
