	<h5>Welcome to my personal website! This is my learning portfolio for the University Honors Program,
		showcasing some of the experiences I've had over my time in college.</h3>
	<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
	<p>
	My name is Sydney O'Connor, and I am a third year student at the University of Cincinnati,
		studying Computer Engineering. I was born in Cincinnati and grew up in Northern Kentucky.
		Both of my parents are UC graduates, so I was born and raised a Bearcat. I went to a small
		private high school overlooking the Ohio River, called Villa Madonna. I loved my time at Villa.
		I was class president, salutatorian and involved in many clubs including varsity soccer and tennis, 
		the school musical, National Honor Society and Sociedad Honoraria Hispanica. My involvement in 
		high school developed my leadership skills and gave me the incredible opportunity to attend the 
		University of Cincinnati as a Cincinnatus Excellence Scholar. I knew that this opportunity was the 
		next step to becoming the newest Bearcat in the family.

	<p>
		I am now a third year at UC and studying engineering, because it allows me to use my problem
		solving skills and academic strengths to innovate new solutions to the world's biggest problems. 
		While I love engineering, being in the field has also developed a passion to fight sexism in engineering
		and encourage more women to enter the field, especially in computing. I am extremely involved on campus, 
		which has helped me grow tremendously in my leadership skills and given me a platform to do something about
		the struggles I see in engineering. I help recruit future Bearcats (and hopefully more women in engineering)
		as a CEAS ambassador and ROAR tour guide. I connect students and alumni through the Student Alumni Council,
		which has helped me to launch a mentorship program for women in computing. I am also a member of the University 
		Honors Program, ACM-W, Kappa Alpha Theta and Student Government, all of which have helped me get involved on 
		campus, develop my strengths, and pursue my passions.  UC has given me so many amazing opportunities to grow
		and learn in my first few years here, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my time here giving back and 
		serving the student body.
