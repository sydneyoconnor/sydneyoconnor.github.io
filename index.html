	<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Sydney O'Connor, and I am a fourth year student at the University of Cincinnati,
		pursuing my B.S. in Computer Engineering and Master of Engineering in Computer Science. 
		I was born and raised in the Cincinnati area and have always been a huge Bearcats fan. When I first 
		came to UC, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I was introduced to programming in my
		freshman courses and found a passion for computer engineering. Now, I've had the opportunity to do three
		co-ops and connect my passions to my field of study. I love supporting and encouraging women in technology
		through my involvement in ACM-W, CEAS Ambassadors, the Student Alumni Council, CWEST and Sigma Phi.
