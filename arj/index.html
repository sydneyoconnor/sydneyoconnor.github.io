  <h1>Accelerating Racial Justice 2017</h1>
  <p>
    ARJ 2017 was an incredibly eye-opening and transformative experience for me. The 5 days we spent discussing 
    racial justice were some of the most challenging and draining days of my life, but they were well worth it.
    Our days were packed with activity, with 3 full sessions every day, each one about 3 hours long, but these
    intense days paved the way for some incredible 
    conversations and experiences that will stay with me for years to come.

  I was very hesitant going into ARJ.  I had a lot going on at home and talking about racial justice for 5 days sounded 
    exhausting. When I arrived at the retreat, for the first time in my life, I felt like a minority. Even though there 
    were plenty of other people there who shared some of my identities, there were also a lot of people who were very different 
    from me. At first, it made me uncomfortable. At that moment, looking around the room, I had a thought that has stuck
    with me ever since, "This is how these people feel every single day." The UC student population is 75% white, as we 
    learned in one activity. I genuinely cannot comprehend walking into class and always being one of, if not the only one 
    who looks the way you do. The thought had never even crossed my mind until then. ARJ opened my eyes to a lot of privilege 
    that I have, but never really fully acknowledged. I knew that I had privilege and that racism was still very alive today, 
    but until I spent five days just listening to people of color talk about their experiences, I didn't really understand it. 
    It was heartbreaking and frustrating and confusing. The first couple of days were really difficult for me. It was hard to 
    swallow how bad things still are, and that even I am to blame for that. 
    I became frustrated and wanted answers. I wanted a step-by-step solution for what I could do to help stop racism.

   As the days went on, I learned that there really is no "plan".  No one has a clean cut answer to solve racism. But there
    is still plenty that I can do. Most importantly, I need to educate myself more. ARJ was a good starting point, but this is a 
    daily fight. The simile thrown around a lot at the retreat was that fighting racism is like brushing your teeth- you need to
    do it every single day. It's also important to note that it's not POC's job to educate me. I had a hard time with this at first. 
    If I can't learn from them, who can I learn from? Fortunately, there are plenty of resources out there. Libraries, clubs,
    speakers, and endless events are held at UC and in Cincinnati to help with this. On top of that, there are POC such as our 
    facilitators who have literally made it their job to educate people on racial justice. These are all great resources. I can 
    use these to educate myself, without forcing my friends of color to take on the emotional burden of educating me. While I
    continue to educate myself,
    I will also be more conscious about identifying microaggressions or even just overt racism, and calling people out on it.

  ARJ was not easy. I'm proud of myself for pushing through, though.  I spent most of the 5 days just listening.  
    It was hard to engage because I didn't feel that the retreat was really my space to talk or share, as a white, 
    cis woman, and many comments made by other white people were met with hostility. It sometimes led to people hanging
    out with people mostly of their own identity.  I know even I was guilty of that, but it was really nice to have some 
    of those people there because we were struggling with the same things and were ultimately able to push each other through
    it, resulting in some great friendships as well. By the end, people started reaching out more, and I began to understand
    the reasoning behind a lot of that hostility.  I was ultimately grateful that I was able to spend my days just listening. 
    I learned to be a truly attentive listener, not to just listen to respond. This active listening allowed me to soak up a 
    lot of knowledge and really reflect on what I was hearing. A lot of it was really challenging, and I'm still trying to process
    everything. However, all of it allowed me to really grow. My beliefs and core foundations have never been challenged like
    they were at ARJ. Some were solidified and made much stronger because of it, while others have begun to shift. I also
    learned inclusive leadership skills, such as risk taking, combating stereotypes, and cultural awareness. I am grateful
    for the connections I made at ARJ. I formed some incredible friendships forged over deep and difficult conversations we
    just don't normally have on a daily basis in society.
    I am excited to continue to reflect on this experience and take my next steps to become an ally.
