  <h1>Python and Women in Stem</h1>
  <p> Freshman year, I decided to study computer engineering. 
    However, I was shocked at the huge gender gap in the field. 
    In my computer engineering class, I was one of only three girls in a class of over 75 people. 
    This gender gap was not only intimidating, but confusing. Why are so few women in this major?
    Is it just not interesting enough? The summer after freshman year, I was determined to not only 
    become a better computer engineer, but to discover the reasons for this gender gap and find out what can be done to change it.
    This inspired a self-designed Honors experience to study Python as well as the role of women in STEM.
